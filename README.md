# Terminal-Simulator
Windows cmd program to run Bash commands

Program will run basic commands without parameters for the prototype

Commands supported in the basic command line program are:

cd - display current directory
ls - list files in current directory
exit - exit program
bash - new instance of the command line
time - display current system time

I plan on adding parameters and other advance functional in another branch
